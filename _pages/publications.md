- FOLEAGE: F4OLE-Based Multi-Party Computation for Boolean Circuits, *Dung Bui, Maxime Bombar, Geoffroy Couteau, Clément Ducros and Sacha Servan-Schreiber*, ASIACRYPT 2024 ([ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/429.pdf),[Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-0938-3_3))

  New method to transform OLE over the field $F_4$ into OLE over field $F_2$, and optimizations of previous PCG based and the QA-SD assumption to target the $F_4$ field. 

-  Correlated Pseudorandomness from the Hardness of Quasi-Abelian Decoding, *Maxime Bombar, Geoffroy Couteau, Alain Couvreur, and Clément Ducros* in CRYPTO 2023 ([ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/845.pdf),[Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38551-3_18))

  We introduce a new PCG for OLE over any field $F_q, q > 2$ , based on a new variant of the Syndrom Decoding assumption, named the Quasi-Abelian Syndrom Decoding. 

- Pseudorandom Correlation Functions from Variable-Density LPN, Revisited, *Geoffroy Couteau and Clément Ducros*, in PKC 2023 ([ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/650.pdf),[Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-31371-4_8))

  We improve over the construction given by Boyle et. al., which introduced the VDLPN assumption and the PCF. We correct a mistake in the original proof and improve drastrically the efficiency.
