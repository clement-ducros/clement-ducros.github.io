I am a third year PhD student, at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/), Université Paris Cité, under the supervision of [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io/) and [Alain Couvreur](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Alain.Couvreur/). 

My thesis topic is *"Linear Codes for Quantum-Resistant Secure Computation"*. More generally, my research interests lie in Secure Multiparty Computation, and Pseudorandomness Generation, Coding Theory, and general Post-Quantum Cryptography.
